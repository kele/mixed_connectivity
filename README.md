# Mixed menger theorem
In 1967 L. W. Beineke and F. Harary published (http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=6709684) a paper called "The connectivity function of a graph". Their main result was a proof of a variation of Menger's theorem, where both vertices and edges are removed. Their result turned out to be flawed and the conjecture is still open.
